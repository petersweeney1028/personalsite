### About Me

Hey everyone - I am Peter. I currently lead growth at Footprint, where we help fintechs, financial institutions, and marketplaces verify identity, prevent fraud, and vault sensitive information.

I started my career in investment banking at GS, where I spent ~3 years on the TMT team. I left back in 2021 to start a company ALAO, which helped micro-celebrities invest in consumer brands. It was a blast; we made plenty of mistakes and learned a ton. In 2022, we sold the company to Commonwealth (for not a lot of money :)).

I loved being a founder and fully intend to do it again. I joined Footprint as the first business hire in hopes to learn everything I can about building a generational company.

These days I spend most of my time working on Footprint, but also explore curiosities (stablecoins, manufacturing, construction, ingredient supply chain, and agriculture), write a blog (as often as I can), and work on side projects. I share and keep track of all the above on this page.

I am always looking to meet cool and interesting people. If you want to chat, feel free to DM me on Twitter.
